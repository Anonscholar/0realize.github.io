Okay so, here's the deal. This site you're reading took me a solid 3-4 hours to set up, which honestly, feels like both an achievement and a personal comedy show. You'd think creating a simple blog would be straighforward, but nah, me being me, I somehow managed to mess up every single step. EVERY. SINGLE. STEP. I had to reinstall, reset, and undo more times than I'd like to admit. An ironic start for a site where I'm supposed to be the one giving advice. 

But here we are! Welcome to a space where I'll be sharing concepts I've learned, questions I've enjoyed, general musings about subjects. I'll be updating this blog regularly with whatever sparks my interest each week - hopefully making your journey through these subjects a bit more entertaining and insightful.[^1]

For now, consider this a soft launch. If I can wrestle a blog together in a single evening, then maybe we’re both off to a promising start! Stay tuned for actual content… assuming I survive round 2 with this site. :)
